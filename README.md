convert a CSV file to a different file format using the Pandas library in Python:

---
This code loads a CSV file called "data.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame, and then uses the to_json(), to_excel(), to_pickle() and to_csv() methods to convert the DataFrame to different file formats.
You can change the file format by changing the extension in the 'to_' methods to the desired format. like if you want to convert to sqlite3 you can use 'to_sql()' and so on.
